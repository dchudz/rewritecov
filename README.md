[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dchudz/rewritecov.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dchudz/rewritecov)

This package extends the notion of 'test coverage' by looking for modifications
it can make without causing errors, which may indicate a gap in testing.

Note that since it runs your code modified, you should be pretty careful
with it! (More on that below.)

## Details

`rewritecov` uses Python's `ast` library to parse your code and then
try running it with various modifications. For any modifications that
don't fail, it reports a gap in coverage.

Currently the modifications it tries are:

- delete a node
- replace function calls with `None`

Once it has tries a given type of modification, it never tries the same
type of modification on a node with the same line number. (This is too
restrictive. We might as well let it try different nodes on the same
line!)

`rewritecov` stops trying rewrites if it ever sees a functon calls
`test_<anything>`. This signals that we've reached the "testing" section
of the code, where checking coverage doesn't make sense like it does for
the "implementation" section.


## Motivation

One time I had to work on a package that was mostly a bunch of
regexes. The way it was structured, if you ran any of the functions, you
ran all of the lines in the function. I didn't add much testing, but when
I was done we still had around "90% coverage".

In fact, the thing had hardly any testing at all.


## Usage and Example

You can install with `pip install git+git://github.com/dchudz/rewritecov.git`.

Then given this code file `example.py`:


```
import re


def munge_some_text(text):
    replacements = [
        (r'[\s+]', r'_'),
        (r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_]', r'')
    ]
    for old, new in replacements:
        text = re.sub(old, new, text)
    return text


def test_it():
    munge_some_text('hi there!')


test_it()
```

... we can run:

```
rewritecov example.py
```

```
Lines with stuff we could delete: 6, 7, 9, 11
Lines with function calls we could replace with None: 10
```

Running `rewritecov example.py --verbose` shows much more info about
what's going on along the way.


## Careful!

Given that `rewritecov` runs your code after modifications, it could
have very unpleasant consequences

## Improvements

This is probably just a toy that's going nowhere, but I still might
work on it a bit, especially if other people are interested.

- The main limitation is maybe that `rewritecov` just operates on a single
source file and isn't integrated at all with any standard testing
frameworks like `pytest`.

- I also haven't thought much about safety. It's possible this thing
should only ever be run in a container that you don't mind destroying.

- It'd be nice to show the actual code that's uncovered and/or report
coverage in a standard format that integrates with coverage-viewing tools.

- It'd be nice to consider more than just one node per line - for example,
adding `col_offset` to our keys in addition to `lineno` would be an
easy step in that direction.

- At a larger scale, it would be pretty inefficient! But I suspect that
doesn't have to be as bad as it sounds. For example, we run something like
this individually for each test after using standard `codecov` to
determine which lines are even hit at all. We wouldn't bother rewriting
lines that aren't hit anyway.

- We could also keep track of which nodes/lines are "covered"
by previous tests, and not bother rewriting anything we already know is
important to the tests.

- More rewrite rules!

- Report coverage in a more standard format.
